This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-s21.github.io/Blog-Nate-Platinum/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)


Let's clean up the format of that output:

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

## Introduction
We live in a world where money and politics are largely intertwined. This fact is starkly apparent when examining the net worth of certain 2020 presidential candidates. Michael Bloomberg, who has a net worth of \$59 billion, spent over \$1 billion on his own candidacy. Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager and billionaire, also made a run for President. The 45th President, Donald Trump, made a fortune through his real estate empire, allocating millions to his campaign. The 2020 election, including both presidential and congressional races, cost a record-breaking $14 billion. Aside from candidates' own wealth, **where is the rest of this campaign money coming from?** We set out to address questions pertaining to 2020 election finance data, seeking to understand who is making political donations and to whom they are supporting.

## Independent Expenditures for Joe Biden & Donald Trump

We obtained data from the [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/president/2020/) to determine how much money different organizations spent either supporting or opposing Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the two main presidential candidates in the 2020 general election. The dataset, called "IndependentExpenditures.csv", contained 863 observations, indicating that there were expenditures from 863 organizations, ranging in size from $2.80 to over $133 million. In order to make a network visualizing the connections between different organizations and the two candidates, we filtered the data to include only donations that were greater than $10 million.

```{r fig.width = 35, fig.height = 15, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

                               name == "Joe Biden" ~ "Joe Biden",
                               TRUE ~ ""))

ggplot(data = expenditures_network, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +

```

The network indicates that:

- The largest donors were skewed more towards Biden then Trump. Biden received support from six organizations, while Trump received support from two. Five organizations opposed Biden while six opposed Trump. 
- Two organizations spent money supporting one candidate and opposing the other: the **FF Pac** made expenditures supporting Joe Biden and opposing Donald Trump, while **Priorities USA Action** did the opposite.
- Candidate priorities align with donors. Conservatives have historically been large advocates for gun rights, explaining why the **NRA Victory Fund** would oppose Biden. Democrats are more invested in combating problems pertaining to climate change and environmental justice, leading the **NextGen Climate Action Committee** to support Biden.

Moving forward, it would be interesting to examine how the number of PACs/organizations and their missions differ at different levels of expenditures.

## All Independent Expenditures
While the network only draws attention to the largest expenditures for the two major candidates, explore this interactive table to learn more about expenditures of all sizes and to all candidates.

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 30}
independent_expenditures %>%
  select(candidate_name, committee_name, total, support_oppose_indicator) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  datatable(
    head(iris)
    )
```

## Individual Contributions

Besides PACs and Super PACs, a significant portion of campaign spending comes from individual contributions. Which candidates amassed the most support from the general public, and which states spent the most on individual contributions?

![This is a static image of the interactive map, outining total individual contributions by state for different candidates. The map was created using the "IndividualContributions.csv" dataset, which I converted to a long format so that each observation included the state, state contribution, and candidate. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat231-s21/Blog-Nate-Platinum/main/images/MapImage.png)

Click [here](http://sedelson31.shinyapps.io/IndividualContributionsMap) to view the interactive map.

 
The map shows that:

- Donald Trump received the most contributions from **California**, **Texas**, **Florida**, and **Virginia**. 

- Joe Biden received the most contributions from **California** and **New York**. 

- Certain candidates who lost in the primaries tended to receive most of their contributions from the states which they have served. For example, Kalama Harris was a California senator and acquired most of her donations from that state. Amy Klobuchar received the most contributions from Minnesota, where she was a senator. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren also obtained a majority of her contributions from her home state.

This map only conveys totals for each state, but we would be interested in further analyzing the average contribution across states, or even more specific municipal levels, and other demographic factors influencing donations. For example, we could test the belief that lower-income, people residing in rural areas tend to support Trump by examining where many of the people that donated up to $20 lived. 

[This](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/02/upshot/america-political-spectrum.html) New York Times Upshot article called _"The True Colors of America's Political Spectrum Are Gray and Green"_ examines how satellite images of the United States tend to be accurate indicators of voting patterns. In the 2016 election, places with more greenery (often rural areas) leaned towards Trump, while places with more gray in the satellite images (indicating roads and buildings) leaned towards Clinton. An extension of this project could be examining how the average number and value of expenditures for each candidate varies across the satellite image color spectrum.

## Individual Contributions Breakdown

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
contribution_breakdown <- read_csv(here("Data", "ContributionBreakdown.csv"))

contribution_breakdown_clean <- contribution_breakdown %>%
  pivot_longer(!Candidate, names_to = "Category", values_to = "Contribution") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(candidate != "Bernie Sanders") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Elizabeth Warren") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Andrew Yang") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Amy Klobuchar") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Tom Steyer") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Michael Bloomberg") %>%
  filter(candidate != "Kamala Harris")


ggplot(data = contribution_breakdown_clean, aes(x=candidate, y=contribution/1000000,fill = candidate)) +
  facet_wrap(~category) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a62c2b", "#4682B4")) +
  ylab("Contribution (Millions)") +
  xlab("") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
